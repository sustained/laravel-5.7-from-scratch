# What is this?

This is me following along with the Laracasts [Laravel from Scratch](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2018) series for Laravel 5.7.

I guess you can consider this both **a part of my portfolio** as well as merely me **working on (re)acquiring skills both old and new**.

**Once done, I'll likely redo things (visually)**--with perhaps Bootstrap, Vuetify, Quasar components or something like that--**to demonstrate that I possess the capabilities required**.

I like to follow the make it work (1); make it work well/properly (2); make it pretty (3) principal.

# Why PHP and Laravel?

Most of my experience as of the last few years has been solely with web technologies--primarily the frontend--as well NodeJS.

I decided **it's time to relearn some old backend-related skills** such as PHP, Postgres, Nginx, server administration/management etc. and to **brush up on some old concepts** like ORMs and MVC and so on.

I have previous experience with PHP from the PHP 5 days, so it seemed like as good a choice as any.

# Who are you?

I'm an unemployed music, (natural) language, gaming, science and technology nerd who is **trying to make himself more employable**.

I like to play Minecraft; watch Doctor Who; listen to Muse; read classic, sci-fi,utopian/dystopian fiction; learn languages and play piano.

My **current focus is on (re)learning modern frontend and backend development tools, technologies and techniques** and my secondary focus is my language learning app for Swedish (my favourite language).

# Where can I find you?

* I spend arguably far too much time [on Discord](https://discordapp.com/) (sustained#2329).
* I have a [temporary website](https://sustained.thepond.xyz/) setup but it doesn't really do much yet.
* I'm not particularly well versed in the [art of tweeting](https://twitter.com/susDissonance), one could argue.
* I don't post [Medium articles](https://medium.com/@sustained) like I should (don't all developers do that?).
* [Here on Github](https://github.com/sustained) you can('t) find my private repos for abandoned projects!
* LinkedIn is overrated (or could be that this is why I don't have a job?).
* etc.

# When did you start?

I became involved with several forum communities around 2003-2004 and shortly thereafter began learning HTML, CSS and PHP in order to be able to help make the forums better.

**It's been a hobby ever since**, on and off at least - burnout and depression is real. I've done several websites for companies (freelancing) but aside from that I have zero professional experience.

It would be nice to get a job doing something I've always enjoyed, but being employable is hard especially with chronic depression. I'll keep working on my [language-learning platform](https://swedishfortoads.xyz/) in hopes that I can support myself though, since *you* won't give me money~
